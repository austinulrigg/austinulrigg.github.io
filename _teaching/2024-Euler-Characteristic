Delivered a presentation to 30 advanced high school students on surfaces with different genera, Eulerâ€™s formula for polyhedra and planar graphs. Additionally, I explained the utilities problem, demonstrated the solution for the genus of a torus, and showed how the utilities problem could be solved on a torus.
