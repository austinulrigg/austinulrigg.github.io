I tutored Calculus 1-3, Intermediate Statistics, and Human Biology. I had other responsibilities in running the tutoring center at Centralia College (delegating responsibilities, directing students to campus resources, responding to queries, etc.), ensuring the tutoring center ran smoothly, forming collaborations with professors at Centralia College, and encouraging a friendly, inclusive environment for all students.
