# Advanced High School & Undergraduate Math Tutoring  
**Proofs, problem-solving, and conceptual clarity—without gatekeeping.**  <!-- benefit-focused -->

I help motivated students—advanced high school through upper-division undergraduates—master core ideas faster, write cleaner proofs, and bridge background gaps that traditional courses sometimes gloss over. (Seattle / UW area & online.)

## Why Work With Me

- **Depth + breadth:** Completed the full UW B.S. math requirements *and* multiple graduate PhD-level sequences (Abstract Algebra 504–506, Combinatorics 563, Linear Algebra 582–583) as an undergraduate.  
- **Real teaching experience:** ~5+ years across high school, community college, university CLUE tutoring, and 2 years as a UW MATH 209 Teaching Assistant.  
- **Research mindset:** Active in topological graph theory research—helps me show *why* techniques work, not only *how*.  
- **Inclusive & student-centered:** I build independence, confidence, and joyful engagement—grounded in the belief that mathematical potential is broadly and equally distributed.  
- **Adaptive approach:** Quickly diagnose missing foundations, then layer rigorous reasoning + strategic practice so students don’t just “get through homework,” they *own* the material.

## Services & Subjects  {#services}

### High School / Early College
AP / Honors Calculus (AB/BC), Precalculus refresh for acceleration, Differential Equations intro, Linear Algebra intro, Enrichment for contest-curious students.

### Core Undergraduate (UW codes)
Calculus: MATH 124–126  
Differential Equations: MATH 207  
Linear Algebra & Analysis: MATH 208, 209, 340  
Introduction to Proofs / Transitions: MATH 300  

### Advanced / Proof & Honors
Honors Accelerated Advanced Calculus: MATH 334–336  
Abstract Algebra: MATH 402–404 (and grad 504–506 perspectives)  
Topology & Differential Geometry: MATH 441, 442–443  
Additional topics on request (ask—if I’m not the right fit I’ll tell you quickly).

### Format
Online (preferred for flexibility & shared whiteboard) or in-person near UW (U District) if convenient. Session length is flexible (most students choose 60 or 90 minutes; longer for exam prep “deep dives”).

## Approach & Philosophy

I assume *every* student can do meaningful mathematics. Sessions focus on conceptual models first, then layered problem families, then reflective synthesis. I probe with “why does this step hold?” questions to cultivate proof fluency and independent checking. We deliberately surface and repair background gaps rather than skating past them. I’m selective: the first meeting is also for me to confirm I can deliver outsized value—if not, I’ll recommend an alternative.

## Rates

I use a sliding structure reflecting course level & preparation required:

- **Foundational / Early HS reinforcement:** from **$30+/hr**
- **AP / Honors Calculus, standard lower-division (124–209):** typical **$40–$55/hr**
- **Upper-division proof / honors / graduate-adjacent (334–336, 402–404, 441–443, etc.):** typically **$55–$70/hr**

Need-based adjustments considered—access matters. I’d rather craft a sustainable plan than have you under-resource your learning. No exact price listed here until we scope your situation; email or form for a fast quote. Cancellation: please give ≥12 hours notice (emergencies excepted).

## How It Works

1. **Reach out** (email or quick form) with course + goals.  
2. **Fit & diagnostic chat (free)** – short call / Zoom: confirm alignment, surface key gaps.  
3. **Plan** – outline targets (exam timeline, concept milestones, proof skill focus).  
4. **Sessions** – active problem solving, targeted mini-explanations, structured “teach-back.”  
5. **Feedback loop** – periodic micro-assessments & adaptation; exam strategy refinement.  

**Q:** Can you help right before an exam?  
**A:** Yes, but earlier engagement yields deeper gains. Short-notice exam triage is possible if openings remain.

**Q:** Will you do my graded work?  
**A:** No. I’ll model reasoning, then you do authentic practice so integrity—and learning—stay intact.

**Q:** How do online sessions work?  
**A:** Shared whiteboard / screen + LaTeX snippets as needed; summary pointers afterward on request.

**Q:** Do you tutor subjects not listed?  
**A:** Ask. If it’s outside my lane, I’ll be candid.
