I am a second-year student studying mathematics at the University of Washington.  My current interests are in graph rotations and graph embeddings, but I am excited to learn and explore lots of fields of mathematics (Currently taking a second year in abstract algebra and starting topology)."

I embrace Federico Ardila-Mantilla's axioms
======
1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries

2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
