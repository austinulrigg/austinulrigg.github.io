# Advanced High School & Undergraduate Math Tutoring  
**Proofs, problem-solving, and conceptual clarity—without gatekeeping.**

I help motivated students—advanced high school through upper-division undergraduates—master core ideas faster, write cleaner proofs, and bridge background gaps that traditional courses sometimes gloss over. (Seattle / UW area & online.)

## Why Work With Me

- **Depth + breadth:** Completed the full UW B.S. math requirements *and* multiple graduate PhD-level sequences (Abstract Algebra 504–506, Combinatorics 563, Linear Algebra 582–583) as an undergraduate.  
- **Real teaching experience:** ~5+ years across high school, community college, university CLUE tutoring, and 2 years as a UW MATH 209 Teaching Assistant.  
- **Research mindset:** Active in topological graph theory research—helps me show *why* techniques work, not only *how*.  
- **Inclusive & student-centered:** I build independence, confidence, and joyful engagement—grounded in the belief that mathematical potential is broadly and equally distributed.  
- **Adaptive approach:** Quickly diagnose missing foundations, then layer rigorous reasoning + strategic practice so students don’t just “get through homework,” they *own* the material.

## Services & Subjects  {#services}

### High School / Early College
AP / Honors Calculus (AB/BC), Precalculus refresh for acceleration, Differential Equations intro, Linear Algebra intro, Enrichment for contest-curious students.

### Core Undergraduate (UW codes)
Calculus: MATH 124–126  
Differential Equations: MATH 207  
Linear Algebra & Analysis: MATH 208, 209, 340  
Introduction to Proofs / Transitions: MATH 300  

### Advanced / Proof & Honors
Honors Accelerated Advanced Calculus: MATH 334–336  
Abstract Algebra: MATH 402–404 (and grad 504–506 perspectives)  
Topology & Differential Geometry: MATH 441, 442–443  
Additional topics on request (ask—if I’m not the right fit I’ll tell you quickly).

### Format
Online (preferred for flexibility & shared whiteboard) or in-person near UW (U District) if convenient. Session length is flexible (most students choose 60 or 90 minutes; longer for exam prep “deep dives”).

## Approach & Philosophy

I assume *every* student can do meaningful mathematics. Sessions focus on conceptual models first, then layered problem families, then reflective synthesis. I probe with “why does this step hold?” questions to cultivate proof fluency and independent checking. We deliberately surface and repair background gaps rather than skating past them. I’m selective: the first meeting is also for me to confirm I can deliver outsized value—if not, I’ll recommend an alternative.

## Rates

Sliding structure reflecting course level & prep:

- **Foundational / Early HS reinforcement:** from **$30+/hr**
- **AP / Honors Calculus, standard lower-division (124–209):** typical **$40–$55/hr**
- **Upper-division proof / honors / graduate-adjacent (334–336, 402–404, 441–443, etc.):** typically **$55–$70/hr**

Need-based adjustments considered—access matters. No exact number until we scope your situation; email or form for a fast quote. Cancellation: ≥12 hours notice (emergencies excepted).

## How It Works

1. Reach out (email or form) with course + goals.  
2. Free fit & diagnostic chat (mutual).  
3. Plan: milestones, exam timeline, proof skill targets.  
4. Sessions: active problem solving + teach-back.  
5. Feedback loop: adjust based on mini-assessments.

## Results & Social Proof

> *“Placeholder: After 6 weeks I stopped memorizing and started **understanding**—my quiz scores jumped.”*  
> *“Placeholder: Proof writing felt impossible; now I draft clean arguments without panic.”*

## FAQs

**Q:** Do you assign extra work?  
**A:** Only high-leverage drills—quality over volume.

**Q:** Last-minute exam prep?  
**A:** Possible if I have a slot; earlier is better.

**Q:** Will you do my graded work?  
**A:** No—integrity + learning first. I help you internalize methods.

**Q:** Online session logistics?  
**A:** Shared whiteboard / screen, LaTeX snippets, optional brief recap.

**Q:** Topic not listed?  
**A:** Ask—I’ll be clear if it’s outside scope.
